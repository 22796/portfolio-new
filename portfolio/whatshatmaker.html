<h1>What is hatmaker?</h1>
<h2>Hatmaker is a webapp I created in my freetime, inspired by the famous cookie clicker.</h2>
<h2>The reason I created it was because I wasn't very good at javascript at the time. I needed to challenge myself, building a webapp from scratch would be the perfect solution.
I learned some basics things while making this project. How to structure code in javascript, use and create variables and more.</h2>
