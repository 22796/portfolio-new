<h1>What is Etiennescheeper.nl?</h1>
<h2>Etiennescheeper.nl is a website, created for a real photographer as a part for a school project.</h2>
<h2>My school, Mediacollege Amsterdam decided to group us students into small development teams. We had to
work together as a group to create a website for a real photographer. Sadly, we had to use Wordpress for this project. Although I didn't need to
code things myself, I still got to learn how to develop in a team. Our client was really happy with the end result.  </p>
