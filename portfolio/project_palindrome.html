<h1>What is this palindrome checker?</h1>
<h2>This palindrome checker is a webapp I created for a school project.</h2>
<h2>A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, when you submit the word "hello", the result will be: "No, that is not palindrome".
Because hello backwards is olleh. A word such as racecar is palindrome, because racecar backwards is still racecar. This webapp will, with the use of javascript, check these things for you. </h2>
